x	Get port order from spice
	Get port direction from verilog

x	Handle differential, equivalent.

x	cin: optimization
x	setup/hold: use hspice bisect
x	    - look at internal node
	    - do not look at internal node
x	clock_q
	power
	path delay module (from static timing output)
	tristate buffer
	device characterization

x	Generate synopsys lib format
	Generate html datasheets

?	tcl GUI interface
-	Load defaults
	Error checking
	    spice run error, aborts
	    terminal existence check

x	Slew rate from exp source instead of slewbuffer.
x	Add resistor for buffer for inputcap.
	Setup/Hold using 5% deviation from idea clock-q time
	    as criterion.

x	slew rate dependence on setup/hold
x	output linear or nonlinear models (clock-q only)
x	index list for nonlinear models -> using lu_table_name

	complete tlf generation


Key:
    x = done
    ? = propably not worth doing
    - = changed my mind
