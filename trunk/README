Requirements:
    1. Perl version 5.004_04 or greater (www.perl.com)
    2. Hspice version 97 or greater (www.avanticorp.com)
    3. Smartspice version 1.5.6.R or greater (www.silvaco.com)

To install autochar:
    1. Edit and source the SETUP file
    2. Type "make install" (Type "man autochar" to read the man page.)
    3. Create the spice tech area, using the $AUTOCHAR/tech as
       an example.
    4. Create a directory where characterizations will be done.
       You may need some hefty disk space since spice tends to
       generate lots of data.  See $AUTOCHAR/example for
       an example of how to set things up.  The actual run
       is in $AUTOCHAR/example/run.  Type 'make' in
       $AUTOCHAR/example/run to see the options.

Contact me if you want to be placed on a mailing list for

Have Fun!
