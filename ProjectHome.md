I am starting this from a point where Robert Yu seems to have left off. The first checkin will be the 1.5.6 version as released by Robert Yu. I will try to take this forward as much as I can.

This used to be available in www.cadfarm.com which is not available any more.

Please contact me if you happen to be Robert Yu.

Please contact me if you are not Robert Yu but already maintaining this autochar.

Please contact me if you would like to take part in the development.
